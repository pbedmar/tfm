\chapter{Introduction}
%Electricity price forecasting attempts to deduce in advance what the price of electricity will be.
%This is a difficult task, as many factors interfere with it: raw materials (as natural gas, coal or uranium) prices, weather conditions or energy demand.
%Apart, the local and global economic situation or tax policies and regulations approved by the government affect, among others.
%
%In this Master's Thesis we want to perform forecasts of the energy price in the short, medium and long term, studying which variables affect the price in the Spanish market.
%Concretely, we want to study hourly, daily, monthly and yearly aggregations.
%Today, after the covid crisis of previous years and the war in Ukraine, prices have been greatly altered, reaching values that have never been seen before.
%In this situation, the completion of this Thesis makes a lot of sense, as we may discover how the market has changed after these two events.
%
%To achieve this goal the author will first select the variables needed to perform the study, download historical data related with them and apply time series analytics tools, both statistical and machine learning based, to understand the data and make forecasts.
In the current situation of transition to clean energy technologies while immersed in the Ukraine war consequences, electricity price forecasting has become a relevant topic. Energy price affects the entire society, from domestic consumers to big industrial clients; and all the sectors like transport, agriculture or services. But for the agents involved in this market, predicting the future price is as important as knowing which variables are affecting it and how: raw materials (as natural gas, coal or uranium) prices or energy demand are some of them. Apart, the local and global economic situation or tax policies and regulations approved by the governments could affect, among others.

That's why in this Master Thesis the author will perform forecasts and study the variables affecting prices. The analysis will be done in an hourly, daily, monthly and yearly fashion, as the series have different properties on different aggregations. Also, the predictors influence will vary on each. Apart, for the hourly and daily cases, the differences between pre-covid and post-war markets will be analyzed.


\section{Project motivation}
The main motivation is to create a product that can can be used by the different market agents to forecast the future electricity prices and to understand what is affecting them and how.

Apart, for the project author will be useful to understand the particularities of working with time series data and to analyze the state of the art in this field.

\section{Objectives}
The project has the following goals:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{[OBJ1]} Forecast electricity price in the short, medium and long term.
    \item \textbf{[OBJ2]} Understand which variables affect the electricity price in the short, medium and long term.
\end{itemize}
